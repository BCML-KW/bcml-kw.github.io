abstract: ' Due to changes in the medical system, an aging population, and the current
  COVID-19 crisis, a lot of interest and investment in the healthcare industry is
  increasing. The development of machine learning technology led by deep learning
  drives its applications to healthcare services. However, the conventional deep learning
  models consume a lot of power and are difficult to miniaturize, so they are not
  suitable for wearable devices required by smart cities. Accordingly, interests in
  spiking neural network (SNN), a next-generation artificial intelligence research
  field with low power and parallelism, are emerging as an alternative. In this paper,
  SNN is designed with STDP, an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns time difference
  between pre and post synapses. It is also applied to ECG arrhythmia data sets and
  produces accuracy, sensitivity and specificity according to cumulative spike-based
  inference. With the experiment results, we want to show the possibility of SNN as
  a healthcare technology and new implications too. '
