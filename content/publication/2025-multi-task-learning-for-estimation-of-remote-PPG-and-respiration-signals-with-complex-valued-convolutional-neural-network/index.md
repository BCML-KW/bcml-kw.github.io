abstract: Remote and continuous biometric signal monitoring has become increasingly
  crucial for the prompt diagnosis of physiological disorders. However, traditional
  contact sensors might pose the risk of virus spread and cause discomfort, thereby
  impeding the continuous monitoring process. Furthermore, the enhancement of
  diagnostic performance using deep neural networks necessitates the use of large
  models, which could be a burden when developing embedded edge devices. Thus, we
  propose a multitask learning model to estimate the remote photoplethysmogram (PPG)
  and respiratory rate simultaneously based on facial videos using complex-valued
  neural networks. The RGB channel images are obtained from a region of interest of
  the facial video streams and a complex-numbered dataset is constructed. The
  multitask learning model designed for the complex domain can yield a small network
  architecture by reducing the number of parameters, which is advantageous for small
  embedded devices. Using a public dataset of face video streams from multiple
  participants, the proposed multitask learning model could simultaneously learn
  the remote PPG and respiratory rate with higher performance and a smaller structure
  compared with conventional real-valued neural networks. These results validate the
  potential of the proposed model for the accurate and efficient remote monitoring
  of physiological disorders.
