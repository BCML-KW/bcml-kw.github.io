abstract: Spiking neural networks, known for mimicking the brain’s functionality resulting
  in efficient algorithms, are gaining attention across various problems and applications.
  However, their potential in regression tasks remains relatively unexplored. This
  study focuses on leveraging the spiking neural architecture in conjunction with
  Fourier analysis and support vector regression to estimate heart rates from electrocardiogram
  signal. We evaluated the regression errors of our model using three distinct elctrocardiogram
  datasets and assessed its performance on neuromorphic hardware by embedding spike-based
  layers. Our findings reveal that, compared to the conventional deep learning models,
  the proposed spiking neural system achieves a computational efficiency improvement
  while maintaining the competitive regression accuracy. Finally, we discuss the regression
  performance, energy efficiency, biological plausibility, and potential applications
  of the proposed neuromorphic system.
