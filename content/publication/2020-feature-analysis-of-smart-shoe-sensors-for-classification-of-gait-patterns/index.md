abstract: Gait analysis is commonly used to detect foot disorders and abnormalities
  such as supination, pronation, unstable left foot and unstable right foot. Early
  detection of these abnormalities could help us to correct the walking posture and
  avoid getting injuries. This paper presents extensive feature analyses on smart
  shoes sensor data, including pressure sensors, accelerometer and gyroscope signals,
  to obtain the optimum combination of the sensors for gait classification, which
  is crucial to implement a power-efficient mobile smart shoes system. In addition,
  we investigated the optimal length of data segmentation based on the gait cycle
  parameters, reduction of the feature dimensions and feature selection for the classification
  of the gait patterns. Benchmark tests among several machine learning algorithms
  were conducted using random forest, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression
  and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms for the classification task. Our experiments
  demonstrated the combination of accelerometer and gyroscope sensor features with
  SVM achieved the best performance with 89.36% accuracy, 89.76% precision and 88.44%
  recall. This research suggests a new state-of-the-art gait classification approach,
  specifically on detecting human gait abnormalities.
