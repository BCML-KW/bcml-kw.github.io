abstract: Recently, the interest in biometric authentication based on electrocardiograms
  (ECGs) has increased. Nevertheless, the ECG signal of a person may vary according
  to factors such as the emotional or physical state, thus hindering authentication.
  We propose an adaptive ECG-based authentication method that performs incremental
  learning to identify ECG signals from a subject under a variety of measurement conditions.
  An incremental support vector machine (SVM) is adopted for authentication implementing
  incremental learning. We collected ECG signals from 11 subjects during 10 min over
  six days and used the data from days 1 to 5 for incremental learning, and those
  from day 6 for testing. The authentication results show that the proposed system
  consistently reduces the false acceptance rate from 6.49% to 4.39% and increases
  the true acceptance rate from 61.32% to 87.61% per single ECG wave after incremental
  learning using data from the five days. In addition, the authentication results
  tested using data obtained a day after the latest training show the false acceptance
  rate being within reliable range (3.5–5.33%) and improvement of the true acceptance
  rate (70.05–87.61%) over five days.
