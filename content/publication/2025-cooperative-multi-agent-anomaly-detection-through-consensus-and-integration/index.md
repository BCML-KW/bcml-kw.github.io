abstract: >
  Anomaly detection based on multivariate time series is essential for safety-critical
  domains, where early identification of abnormal patterns ensures system reliability.
  Traditional single-agent models and static ensembles often fail to capture complex
  interchannel dependencies and dynamic anomaly propagation. To address these limitations,
  this study proposes a multi-agent collaborative anomaly detection framework that
  integrates Large Language Models and distributed intelligence. The framework consists
  of hierarchical agent types including base detectors, consensus agents, ensemble
  agents, and a master integrator coordinated through trust-based communication and
  adaptive selection mechanisms. Experiments on the Mars Science Laboratory dataset
  demonstrate substantial improvements over individual agents, particularly in recall
  and F1 score, confirming the effectiveness of adaptive multi-agent cooperation.
