abstract: A spiking neural network (SNN) is a type of artificial neural network that
  operates based on discrete spikes to process timing information, similar to the
  manner in which the human brain processes real-world problems. In this paper, we
  propose a new spiking neural network (SNN) based on conventional, biologically plausible
  paradigms, such as the leaky integrate-and-fire model, spike timing-dependent plasticity,
  and the adaptive spiking threshold, by suggesting new biological models; that is,
  dynamic inhibition weight change, a synaptic wiring method, and Bayesian inference.
  The proposed network is designed for image recognition tasks, which are frequently
  used to evaluate the performance of conventional deep neural networks. To manifest
  the bio-realistic neural architecture, the learning is unsupervised, and the inhibition
  weight is dynamically changed; this, in turn, affects the synaptic wiring method
  based on Hebbian learning and the neuronal population. In the inference phase, Bayesian
  inference successfully classifies the input digits by counting the spikes from the
  responding neurons. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed biological
  model ensures a performance improvement compared with other biologically plausible
  SNN models.
