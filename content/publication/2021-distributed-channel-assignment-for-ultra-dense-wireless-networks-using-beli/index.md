abstract: An efficient channel assignment plays an important role in mitigating co-channel
  interference in ultra-dense wireless networks. A simple solution is to separate
  interfering network nodes into orthogonal channels to reduce the interference among
  them. However, determining the optimal channel assignment is considered to be a
  non-linear problem, which may also be associated with practical implementation issues
  such as high computational complexity and control signaling issues. In an effort
  to cope with these challenging issues, we propose a distributed channel assignment
  algorithm that efficiently finds the optimal channel configuration by utilizing
  the concept of belief propagation. Based on a message-passing framework, the proposed
  distributed channel assignment algorithm maximizes the overall sum rate of the ultra-dense
  network with a low computational load for each network node. In addition, we design
  a network protocol and frame format to implement the proposed message-passing framework
  to real-world wireless networks. The main advantage of the proposed approach is
  that network nodes autonomously determine the optimal channel assignment and rapidly
  adapt to dynamic changes of the network. Simulation results confirm that the proposed
  distributed channel assignment algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms in
  terms of various network performance aspects, such as the sum rate, scalability,
  latency, and user mobility.
