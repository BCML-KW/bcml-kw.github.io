abstract: The Strong Uncorrelating Transform Complex Common Spatial Patterns (SUTCCSP)
  algorithm, designed for multichannel data analysis, has a limitation on keeping
  the correlation information among channels during the simultaneous diagonalization
  process of the covariance and pseudocovariance matrices. This paper focuses on the
  importance of preserving the correlation information among multichannel data and
  proposes the correlation assisted SUTCCSP (CASUT) algorithm to address this issue.
  The performance of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated by classifying the motor
  imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset. The features were first extracted using
  CSP algorithms including the proposed method, and then the random forest classifier
  was utilized for the classification. Experiments using CASUT yielded an average
  classification accuracy of 78.10 (%), which significantly outperformed those of
  original CSP, Complex Common Spatial Patterns (CCSP), and SUTCCSP with p-values
  less than 0.01, tested by the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
