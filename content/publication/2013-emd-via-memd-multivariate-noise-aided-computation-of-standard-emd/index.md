abstract: A noise-assisted approach in conjunction with multivariate empirical mode
  decomposition (MEMD) algorithm is proposed for the computation of empirical mode
  decomposition (EMD), in order to produce localized frequency estimates at the accuracy
  level of instantaneous frequency. Despite many advantages of EMD, such as its data
  driven nature, a compact decomposition, and its inherent ability to process nonstationary
  data, it only caters for signals with a sufficient number of local extrema. In addition,
  EMD is prone to mode-mixing and is designed for univariate data. We show that the
  noise-assisted MEMD (NA-MEMD) approach, which utilizes the dyadic filter bank property
  of MEMD, provides a solution to the above problems when used to calculate standard
  EMD. The method is also shown to alleviate the effects of noise interference in
  univariate noise-assisted EMD algorithms which directly add noise to the data. The
  efficacy of the proposed method, in terms of improved frequency localization and
  reduced mode-mixing, is demonstrated via simulations on electroencephalogram (EEG)
  data sets, over two paradigms in brain-computer interface (BCI).
