abstract: Motor imagery refers to the brain’s response during the mental simulation
  of physical activities, which can be detected through electroencephalogram (EEG)
  signals. However, EEG signals exhibit a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to various
  artifacts originating from other physiological sources. To enhance the classification
  performance of motor imagery tasks by increasing the SNR of EEG signals, several
  signal decomposition approaches have been proposed. Empirical mode decomposition
  (EMD) has shown promising results in extracting EEG components associated with motor
  imagery tasks more effectively than traditional linear decomposition algorithms
  such as Fourier and wavelet methods. Nevertheless, the EMD-based algorithm suffers
  from a significant challenge known as mode mixing, where frequency components intertwine
  with the intrinsic mode functions obtained through EMD. This issue severely hampers
  the accuracy of motor imagery classification. Despite numerous algorithms proposed,
  mode mixing remains a persistent issue. In this paper, we propose the Deep-EMD algorithm,
  a deep neural network-based approach to mode mixing problem. We employ two datasets
  to compare the motor imagery classification and mode mixing improvement achieved
  by the conventional EMD algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
  Deep-EMD algorithm effectively mitigates the mode mixing problem in decomposed EEG
  components, leading to improved motor imagery classification performance.
