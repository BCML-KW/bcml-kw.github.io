abstract: Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is important for patients with
  hypertension. However, BP measurement with a cuff may be cumbersome for the patient.
  To overcome this limitation, various studies have suggested cuffless BP estimation
  models using deep learning algorithms. A generalized model should be considered
  to decrease the training time, and the model reproducibility should be taken into
  account in multi-day scenarios. In this study, a BP estimation model with a bidirectional
  long short-term memory network is proposed. The features are extracted from the
  electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram, and ballistocardiogram. The leave-one-subject-out
  (LOSO) method is incorporated to generalize the model and fine-tuning is applied.
  The model was evaluated using one-day and multi-day tests. The proposed model achieved
  a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.56 and 2.05 mmHg for the systolic and diastolic
  BP (SBP and DBP), respectively, in the one-day test. Moreover, the results demonstrated
  that the LOSO method with fine-tuning was more compatible in the multi-day test.
  The MAE values of the model were 5.82 and 5.24 mmHg for the SBP and DBP, respectively.
