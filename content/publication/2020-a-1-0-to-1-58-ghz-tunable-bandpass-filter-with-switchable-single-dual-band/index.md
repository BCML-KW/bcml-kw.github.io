abstract: AbstractA tunable bandpass filter with switchable single‐/dual‐band responses
  is presented. The single‐band to dual‐band transformation is achieved by controlling
  frequencies of poles in a passband. The frequencies of poles are adjusting by using
  a coupled structure with two coupling capacitors. A filter with both 4‐pole single‐band
  and 2‐pole dual‐band characteristics is built on a Duroid substrate with εr = 3.0
  and h = 30 mils. The tuning of the center frequency and the passband transformation
  are done using silicon varactor diodes. In the 4‐pole single‐passband mode, a center
  frequency tuning of 1.0 to 1.4 GHz is achieved with 1‐dB bandwidths of 150 to 198 MHz.
  The 2‐pole dual‐band bandpass filter mode has the center frequency tuning of 1.0
  to 1.29 GHz (low‐band) and 1.4 to 1.58 GHz (high‐band). The application areas are
  in wideband cognitive radios.
