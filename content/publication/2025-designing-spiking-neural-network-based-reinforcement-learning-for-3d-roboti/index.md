abstract: This study investigates a novel approach to robotic arm control through
  integrating spiking neural networks with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy
  gradient reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, it presents the first application
  of spiking neural networks-based twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient
  in 3D robotic manipulation, demonstrating its extension from traditional 2D tasks
  to complex 3D target-reaching scenarios with improved energy efficiency and stability.
  Additionally, with the inertial measurement unit data the system successfully mimics
  human arm movements, achieving a success rate of 0.95 among 50 trials and enabling
  an intuitive and accurate human–robot interaction system. This pioneering attempt
  highlights the feasibility of combining the biologically inspired spiking neural
  networks with the reinforcement learning algorithm to address the real-time challenges
  in high-dimensional robotic environments and advance the field of human–robot interaction
  systems.
