abstract: Wearable technologies are known to improve our quality of life. Among the
  various wearable devices, shoes are non-intrusive, lightweight, and can be used
  for outdoor activities. In this study, we estimated the energy consumption and heart
  rate in an environment (i.e., running on a treadmill) using smart shoes equipped
  with triaxial acceleration, triaxial gyroscope, and four-point pressure sensors.
  The proposed model uses the latest deep learning architecture which does not require
  any separate preprocessing. Moreover, it is possible to select the optimal sensor
  using a channel-wise attention mechanism to weigh the sensors depending on their
  contributions to the estimation of energy expenditure (EE) and heart rate (HR).
  The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the root mean squared
  error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2).
  Moreover, the RMSE was 1.05 ± 0.15, MAE 0.83 ± 0.12 and R2 0.922 ± 0.005 in EE estimation.
  On the other hand, and RMSE was 7.87 ± 1.12, MAE 6.21 ± 0.86, and R2 0.897 ± 0.017
  in HR estimation. In both estimations, the most effective sensor was the z axis
  of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Through these results, it is demonstrated
  that the proposed model could contribute to the improvement of the performance of
  both EE and HR estimations by effectively selecting the optimal sensors during the
  active movements of participants.
