abstract: This letter proposes a novel adaptive bandpass filter with reconfigurable
  center frequency and bandwidth (BW) based on a deep Q-network (DQN). To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a DQN-based tunable filter
  capable of simultaneously adjusting both frequency and BW. To improve filter-control
  efficiency, a method using only positive voltage actions is introduced. Additionally,
  a reward equation is formulated to enable the DQN to effectively control both the
  frequency and the BW. The proposed approach is validated through the design of a
  two-pole adaptive filter.
