abstract: In this study, the optimal features of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were
  investigated for the implementation of a personal authentication system using a
  reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. ECG signals were recorded from 11 subjects
  for 6 days. Consecutive 5-day datasets (from the 1st to the 5th day) were trained,
  and the 6th dataset was tested. To search for the optimal features of ECG for the
  authentication problem, RL was utilized as an optimizer, and its internal model
  was designed based on deep learning structures. In addition, the deep learning architecture
  in RL was automatically constructed based on an optimization approach called Bayesian
  optimization hyperband. The experimental results demonstrate that the feature selection
  process is essential to improve the authentication performance with fewer features
  to implement an efficient system in terms of computation power and energy consumption
  for a wearable device intended to be used as an authentication system. Support vector
  machines in conjunction with the optimized RL algorithm yielded accuracy outcomes
  using fewer features that were approximately 5%, 3.6%, and 2.6% higher than those
  associated with information gain (IG), ReliefF, and pure reinforcement learning
  structures, respectively. Additionally, the optimized RL yielded mostly lower equal
  error rate (EER) values than the other feature selection algorithms, with fewer
  selected features.
