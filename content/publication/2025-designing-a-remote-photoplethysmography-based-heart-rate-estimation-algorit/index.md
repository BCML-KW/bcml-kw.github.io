abstract: Remote photoplethysmography is a technology that estimates heart rate by
  detecting changes in blood volume induced by heartbeats and the resulting changes
  in skin color through imaging. This technique is fundamental for the noncontact
  acquisition of physiological signals from the human body. Despite the notable progress
  in remote-photoplethysmography algorithms for estimating heart rate from facial
  videos, challenges remain in accurately assessing heart rate during cardiovascular
  exercises such as treadmill or elliptical workouts. To address these issues, research
  has been conducted in various fields. For example, an understanding of optics can
  help solve these issues. Careful design of video production is also crucial. Approaches
  in computer vision and deep learning with neural networks can also be applied. We
  focused on developing a practical approach to improve heart rate estimation algorithms
  under constrained conditions. To address the limitations of motion blur during high-motion
  activities, we introduced a novel motion-based algorithm. While existing methods
  like CHROM, LGI, OMIT, and POS incorporate correction processes, they have shown
  limited success in environments with significant motion. By analyzing treadmill
  data, we identified a relationship between motion changes and heart rate. With an
  initial heart rate provided, our algorithm achieved over a 15 bpm improvement in
  mean absolute error and root mean squared error compared to existing methods, along
  with more than double the Pearson correlation. We hope this research contributes
  to advancements in healthcare and monitoring.
