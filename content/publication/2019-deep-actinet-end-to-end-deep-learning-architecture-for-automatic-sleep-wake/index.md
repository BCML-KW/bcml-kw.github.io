abstract: Sleep scoring is the first step for diagnosing sleep disorders. A variety
  of chronic diseases related to sleep disorders could be identified using sleep-state
  estimation. This paper presents an end-to-end deep learning architecture using wrist
  actigraphy, called Deep-ACTINet, for automatic sleep-wake detection using only noise
  canceled raw activity signals recorded during sleep and without a feature engineering
  method. As a benchmark test, the proposed Deep-ACTINet is compared with two conventional
  fixed model based sleep-wake scoring algorithms and four feature engineering based
  machine learning algorithms. The datasets were recorded from 10 subjects using three-axis
  accelerometer wristband sensors for eight hours in bed. The sleep recordings were
  analyzed using Deep-ACTINet and conventional approaches, and the suggested end-to-end
  deep learning model gained the highest accuracy of 89.65%, recall of 92.99%, and
  precision of 92.09% on average. These values were approximately 4.74% and 4.05%
  higher than those for the traditional model based and feature based machine learning
  algorithms, respectively. In addition, the neuron outputs of Deep-ACTINet contained
  the most significant information for separating the asleep and awake states, which
  was demonstrated by their high correlations with conventional significant features.
  Deep-ACTINet was designed to be a general model and thus has the potential to replace
  current actigraphy algorithms equipped in wristband wearable devices.
