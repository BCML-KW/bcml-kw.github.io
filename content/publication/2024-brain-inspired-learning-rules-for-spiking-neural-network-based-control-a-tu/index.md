abstract: Robotic systems rely on spatio-temporal information to solve control tasks.
  With advancements in deep neural networks, reinforcement learning has significantly
  enhanced the performance of control tasks by leveraging deep learning techniques.
  However, as deep neural networks grow in complexity, they consume more energy and
  introduce greater latency. This complexity hampers their application in robotic
  systems that require real-time data processing. To address this issue, spiking neural
  networks, which emulate the biological brain by transmitting spatio-temporal information
  through spikes, have been developed alongside neuromorphic hardware that supports
  their operation. This paper reviews brain-inspired learning rules and examines the
  application of spiking neural networks in control tasks. We begin by exploring the
  features and implementations of biologically plausible spike-timing-dependent plasticity.
  Subsequently, we investigate the integration of a global third factor with spike-timing-dependent
  plasticity and its utilization and enhancements in both theoretical and applied
  research. We also discuss a method for locally applying a third factor that sophisticatedly
  modifies each synaptic weight through weight-based backpropagation. Finally, we
  review studies utilizing these learning rules to solve control tasks using spiking
  neural networks.
