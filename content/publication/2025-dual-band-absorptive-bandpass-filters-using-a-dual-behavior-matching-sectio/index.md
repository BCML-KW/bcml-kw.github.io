abstract: This study introduces a dual-band absorptive bandpass filter that employs
  a dual-behavior matching section. The proposed design utilizes a filter methodology
  based on a low-pass filter prototype, enabling the development of higher-order distributed
  dual-band absorptive bandpass filters with the control of two center frequencies
  and bandwidths. The proposed filter requires fewer resonators than the existing
  dual-band absorptive filters owing to the dual-band matching section design based
  on an image parameter method. The proposed configuration is implemented to design
  and fabricate two filter prototypes with center frequencies of 1.3 GHz and 1.6 GHz
  on a substrate characterized by a relative permittivity <inline-formula> <tex-math
  notation="LaTeX">$\varepsilon _{\mathrm {r}}=3.42$ </tex-math></inline-formula>
  and a thickness <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$h=30$ </tex-math></inline-formula>
  mil. The first filter (two-pole configuration) demonstrated a measured return loss
  exceeding 11.3 dB at 0.8–2.2 GHz, and the second filter with three-pole exhibited
  a measured return loss exceeding 10.2 dB at 0.8–2.2 GHz. These dual-band absorptive
  bandpass filters are suitable for application in cognitive radio and carrier aggregation
  systems.
