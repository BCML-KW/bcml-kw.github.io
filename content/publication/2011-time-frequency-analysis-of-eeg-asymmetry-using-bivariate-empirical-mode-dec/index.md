abstract: A novel method is introduced to determine asymmetry, the lateralization
  of brain activity, using extension of the algorithm empirical mode decomposition
  (EMD). The localized and adaptive nature of EMD make it highly suitable for estimating
  amplitude information across frequency for nonlinear and nonstationary data. Analysis
  illustrates how bivariate extension of EMD (BEMD) facilitates enhanced spectrum
  estimation for multichannel recordings that contain similar signal components, a
  realistic assumption in electroencephalography (EEG). It is shown how this property
  can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the marginalized spectrum, critical
  for the localized calculation of amplitude asymmetry in frequency. Simulations on
  synthetic data sets and feature estimation for a brain–computer interface (BCI)
  application are used to validate the proposed asymmetry estimation methodology.
