abstract: 'In modern times, people predominantly use personal vehicles as a means
  of transportation, and, as this trend has developed, services that enable consumers
  to rent vehicles instead of buying their own have emerged. These services have grown
  into an industry, and the demand for predicting rental prices has arisen with the
  number of consumers. This study addresses the challenge in accurately predicting
  rental prices using big data with numerous features, and presents the experiments
  conducted and results obtained by applying various machine learning (ML) algorithms
  to enhance the prediction accuracy. Our experiment was conducted in two parts: single-
  and multi-step forecasting. In the single-step forecasting experiment, we employed
  random forest regression (RFR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), 1D convolutional neural
  network (1D-CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and the autoregressive integrated
  moving average (ARIMA) model to predict car rental prices and compared the results
  of each model. In the multi-step forecasting experiment, rental prices after 7,
  14, 21 and 30 days were predicted using the algorithms applied in single-step forecasting.
  The prediction performance was improved by applying Bayesian optimization hyperband.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the LSTM and ARIMA models were effective
  in predicting car rental prices. Based on these results, useful information could
  be provided to both rental car companies and consumers.'
