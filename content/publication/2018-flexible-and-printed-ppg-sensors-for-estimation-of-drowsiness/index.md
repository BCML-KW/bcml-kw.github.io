abstract: We report printed flexible optoelectronic sensors composed of red organic
  light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs) for detection of various
  biological signals in a photoplethysmograph (PPG) device. Fabricated flexible OLEDs
  achieved maximum luminance >1000 cd/m<sup>2</sup> at 9 V, with peak at 640 nm. Maximum
  flexible OPD photosensitivity for the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2, 5-diyl) and phenyl-C61-butyric
  acid methyl ester (PCBM) heterojunction is <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$
  {2} \times {10}^{{2}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> at 0 V and 1.76 at −1 V, irradiated
  with 1.2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at 660 nm. The diketopyrrolopyrrole thieno [3,2-b]thiophene
  blended with PCBM OPDs with poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate
  anode showed photosensitivity = 84 at −1 V bias to almost <inline-formula> <tex-math
  notation="LaTeX">${6} \times {10}^{{4}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> at 0 V accompanied
  by low dark current (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${9.5} \times {10}^{-{8}}$
  </tex-math></inline-formula> A/cm<sup>2</sup> at −1 V). PPG signals were successfully
  detected using the developed flexible PPG sensor and the conventional driving circuit.
  Human studies were conducted to evaluate the flexible PPG sensor performance in
  practical applications. Subject drowsiness was estimated from heart rate variability,
  extracted from the PPG signals, using machine learning algorithms. The flexible
  PPG sensor achieved 79.2% accuracy and 72.1% area under the receiver (AUC) to predict
  drowsiness (60-s window), which are meaningful results compared with conventional
  PPG sensors (83.3% accuracy and 69% AUC). Drowsiness estimation experiments using
  two PPG signals showed that the flexible PPG sensor achieved similar or better performance
  compared to conventional PPG sensors.
