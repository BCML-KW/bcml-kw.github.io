abstract: Authentications using biometrics, such as fingerprint recognition and electrocardiogram
  (ECG), have been actively used in various applications. Unlike traditional authentication
  methods, such as passwords or PINs, biometric-based authentication has an advantage
  in terms of security owing to its capability of liveness detection. Among the various
  types of biometrics, ECG-based authentication is widely utilized in many fields.
  Because of the inherent characteristics of ECG, however, the incautious design of
  ECG-based authentication may result in serious leakage of personal private information.
  In this paper, we extensively investigate ECG-based authentication schemes previously
  proposed in the literature and analyze possible privacy leakages by employing machine
  learning and deep learning techniques. We found that most schemes suffer from vulnerabilities
  that lead to the leakage of personal information, such as gender, age, and even
  diseases. We also identified some privacy-insensitive ECG fiducial points by utilizing
  feature selection algorithms. Based on these features, we present a privacy-preserving
  ECG-based authentication scheme.
