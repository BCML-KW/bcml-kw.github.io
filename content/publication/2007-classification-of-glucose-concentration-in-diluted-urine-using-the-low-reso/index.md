abstract: In order to detect minute amounts of glucose in diluted urine, we applied
  the Raman spectroscopy method. To simulate abnormal diluted urine in a toilet bowl,
  we diluted normal urine ten-fold with water and added glucose up to 8 mg dl−1. Data
  were collected using a low-resolution Raman spectrometer that was preprocessed with
  the optimizing kernel method. We also applied the neural network algorithm to classify
  abnormal and normal urine samples according to their glucose concentrations. The
  kernel optimizing method was very effective in the classification of the tested
  subjects as it increased the accuracy of classification by 92%. This method suggests
  the possibility of caring for patients by daily monitoring their urine components
  in a manner non-invasive to ordinary life.
