abstract: Nonexcitable cell types, fibroblasts of heart muscle or astrocytes, are
  well known for their spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. On the other hand, murine fibroblast
  (L929) cells are known to be deficient in cell–cell adhesive proteins and therefore
  lack gap junctions for cellular communication. However, these cells exhibit a unique
  property of collectively synchronized and spontaneous oscillation, as revealed by
  real-time monitoring of cells cultured on a 250-μm diameter microelectrode for more
  than 3 days using an electrical cell-substrate impedance-sensing system (ECIS).
  Live-cell imaging is a widely used technique for oscillation detection, but it has
  limitations relating to cellular physiological environment maintenance for microscopic
  analysis and for prolonged periods of study. The present research emphasizes an
  electrical-sensing technique (ECIS) capable of overcoming the most important issues
  inherent in live-cell imaging systems for the detection of L929 cellular spontaneous
  and synchronized oscillation in real-time for longer periods. Possible mechanisms
  involved in L929 oscillation were elucidated to be periodic extension/contraction
  of lamellipodia continued as blebbing, which is produced by signals from the actomyosin
  complex initiated by connexin hemichannel opening and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  release. By applying the connexin hemichannel inhibitor, flufenamic acid, the hindrance
  of ATP release and calcium transients were analyzed to elucidate this hypothesis.
