abstract: In this study, we analyze the effect of a recliner chair with rocking motions
  on sleep quality of naps using automated sleep scoring and spindle detection models.
  The quality of sleep corresponding to the two rocking motions was measured quantitatively
  and qualitatively. For the quantitative evaluation, we conducted a sleep parameter
  analysis based on the results of the estimated sleep stages obtained on the brainwave
  and spindle estimation, and a sleep survey assessment from the participants was
  analyzed for the qualitative evaluation. The analysis showed that sleep in the recliner
  chair with rocking motions positively increased the duration of the spindles and
  deep sleep stage, resulting in improved sleep quality.
