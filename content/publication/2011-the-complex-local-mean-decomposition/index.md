abstract: The local mean decomposition (LMD) has been recently developed for the analysis
  of time series which have nonlinearity and nonstationarity. The smoothed local mean
  of the LMD surpasses the cubic spline method used by the empirical mode decomposition
  (EMD) to extract amplitude and frequency modulated components. To process complex-valued
  data, we propose complex LMD, a natural and generic extension to the complex domain
  of the original LMD algorithm. It is shown that complex LMD extracts the frequency
  modulated rotation and envelope components. Simulations on both artificial and real-world
  complex-valued signals support the analysis.
