abstract: Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) has been rigorously extending its
  applications to hospitals to deliver important medical data remotely and continuously
  with various types of smart medical sensors. Medical data of patients should be
  treated with different urgency levels. Specifically, critical medical data, such
  as data pertaining, to heart failure or fall risk must be transmitted first with
  the highest priority. Thus, priority-aware scheduling for H-IoT networks is required
  to improve the quality of medical services. However, due to the high-dense nature
  of H-IoT networks, interference and packet collisions can make finding the optimal
  priority-aware scheduling very challenging. To tackle these practical issues, we
  develop a priority-aware scheduling algorithm based on a message-passing framework.
  With a message-passing procedure that relies on a max-product rule, the proposed
  algorithm simultaneously maximizes the priority metric and throughput of the network.
  In addition, the proposed algorithm efficiently finds the best scheduling configuration
  without a central coordinator by enabling low complexity and autonomous decisions
  of each network node. Our simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm
  outperforms conventional schemes in terms of priority awareness, throughput performance,
  and network scalability.
