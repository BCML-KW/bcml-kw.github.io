abstract: The ever-growing field of wireless communication requires efficient radio
  frequency transceivers with tunable absorptive bandstop filters that can prevent
  the interference of out-of-band and reflected signals. This paper presents 4-pole
  tunable absorptive bandstop filters using folded coupled-lines with an inductor.
  A 4-pole filter transfer function is achieved to obtain an absorptive bandstop filter
  coupling diagram with 45° electrical-length transmission-line source/load coupling.
  The folded-loaded coupled-lines with an inductor are proposed to obtain the control
  for the required coupling coefficients based on the filter transfer functions. The
  required quality factor extracted through the transfer function is accomplished
  using a distributed resonator loaded with asymmetrical varactors without auxiliary
  circuits, such as an impedance-matching network. Two types of filters were designed
  and built on a substrate with and mil. The center frequency tuning was performed
  using silicon varactors. The first filter shows a return loss of 16.2–38 dB and
  a rejection level of 41–48 dB in the tuning range 0.83–1.09 GHz. The second filter
  results in a measured return loss of 14–34 dB and a rejection level of 40.1–51 dB
  at 1.16–1.47 GHz. 4-pole tunable absorptive bandstop filters with high attenuation
  and reflectionless responses were achieved which have applications in cognitive
  radios and carrier aggregation systems.
