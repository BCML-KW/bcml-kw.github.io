abstract: A personal computer (PC)-based audiometer was developed for interactive
  remote audiometry. This paper describes a tele-audiometric system and evaluates
  the performance of the device when compared with conventional face-to-face audiometry.
  The tele-audiometric system is fully PC-based. A sound card featuring a high-quality
  digital-to-analog converter is used as a pure-tone generator. The audiometric programs
  were developed based on Microsoft Windows in order to maximize usability. Audiologists
  and their subjects can use the tele-audiometry system as one would utilize any PC
  application. A calibration procedure has been applied for the standardization of
  sound levels in the remote system. The performance of this system was evaluated
  by comparing PC-based audiometry with the conventional clinical audiometry system
  for 37 subjects. Also, performance of the PC-based system was evaluated during use
  at a remote site. The PC-based audiometry system estimated the audiometric threshold
  with an error of less than 2.3 dBSPL. Only 10.7% of the results exhibited an error
  greater than 5 dBSPL during use at a remote site. The PC-based tele-audiomerty showed
  acceptable results for use at a remote site. This PC-based system can be used effectively
  and easily in many locations that have Internet access but no local audiologists.
