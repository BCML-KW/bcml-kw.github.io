abstract: This paper presents tunable absorptive dual-notch filters using a stub-loaded
  coupled line with an inductor. The two-pole Butterworth filter function is modified
  to attain absorptive responses at a notch frequency. In addition, a stub-loaded
  coupled line with an inductor is employed to obtain dual-band bandstop responses,
  the required coupling coefficients, and quality factors based on the modified Butterworth
  function at two notch frequencies. In the proposed filter, tunable absorptive dual-notch
  responses are accomplished without using auxiliary circuits, such as an impedance
  matching network. The two resonant frequencies and the quality factors of the resonators
  are independently controlled by adjusting the three loading capacitances of the
  resonator. Three types of filters are designed and then built on a substrate with
  εr = 3.42 and h = 30 mils. The first filter (Filter A) attained a return loss of
  11.2–17.1 dB/10.5–24.4 dB at 0.76–0.98 GHz/1.05–1.28 GHz. The measured return loss
  of the second filter (Filter B) was 12.5–14.8 dB/10.2–12.3 dB at 0.84–1.08 GHz/1.35–1.59
  GHz. For Filter C, equipped with a 4-pole response achieved through the cascade
  connection of two 2-pole filters (Filter B), a return loss of 11.2–15.1 dB/14.2–27.3
  dB was obtained at 0.9–1.1 GHz/1.38–1.63 GHz. The application areas of the proposed
  filters include cognitive radios and carrier aggregation systems requiring two transmit
  frequencies.
