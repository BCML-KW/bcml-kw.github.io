abstract: Advances in mixed reality and blockchain technology in Metaverse are transforming
  the digital healthcare by enabling real-time health monitoring and remote medical
  treatments. This significantly enhances patient care and medical interactions, permitting
  virtual consultations without the need for physical hospital visits. This study
  utilized a dynamic vision sensor camera to track white blood cells and employed
  spiking neural networks to classify and analyze event-based data from nail capillaries.
  Additionally, the soft-reset integrate-and-fire neuron model, which adjusts the
  membrane potential by subtracting the threshold post-spike, was used to optimize
  the training of spiking neural networks. Surrogate gradient learning, which approximates
  gradients for non-differentiable spiking functions, was also applied to enhance
  the training process. The results confirmed that the classification performance
  of white blood cells achieved an accuracy of 80.48%, with precision and recall at
  99.65% and 78.47% respectively, and F1-score of 86.62%.
