abstract: >-
    Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact monitoring of
    biomedical signals using a camera, making it suitable for telemedicine and
    remote health monitoring. This paper proposes an end-to-end convolutional
    neural network (CNN) model for estimating blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) from
    video data. The model is trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset,
    showing promising results in accurately estimating SpO2 levels. The proposed
    approach has the potential to enhance remote health monitoring systems by
    providing a non-invasive method for SpO2 estimation.
