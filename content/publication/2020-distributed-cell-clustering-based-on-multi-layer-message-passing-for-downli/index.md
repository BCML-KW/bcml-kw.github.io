abstract: Joint processing coordinated multipoint transmission (JP-CoMP) has gained
  high attention as part of the effort to cope with the increasing levels of demand
  in the next-generation wireless communications systems. By clustering neighboring
  cells and with cooperative transmission within each cluster, JP-CoMP efficiently
  mitigates inter-cell interference and improves the overall system throughput. However,
  choosing the optimal clustering is formulated as a nonlinear mathematical problem,
  making it very challenging to find a practical solution. In this paper, we propose
  a distributed cell clustering algorithm that maximizes the overall throughput of
  the JP-CoMP scheme. The proposed algorithm renders the nonlinear mathematical problem
  of JP-CoMP clustering into an approximated linear formulation and introduces a multi-layer
  message-passing framework in order to find an efficient solution with a very low
  computational load. The main advantages of the proposed algorithm are that i) it
  enables distributed control among neighboring cells without the need for any central
  coordinators of the network; (ii) the computational load imposed on each cell is
  kept to a minimum; and, (iii) required message exchanges via backhaul result in
  only small levels of overhead on the network. The simulation results verify that
  the proposed algorithm finds an efficient JP-CoMP clustering that outperforms previous
  algorithms in terms of both the sum throughput and edge user throughput. Moreover,
  the convergence properties and the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm
  are compared with those of previous algorithms, confirming its usefulness in practical
  implementations.
