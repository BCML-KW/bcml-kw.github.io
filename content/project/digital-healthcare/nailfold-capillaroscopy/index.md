## Abstract

Nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) enables early detection of systemic sclerosis, lupus, and other microvascular disorders by imaging capillaries at the nailbed. We are building a turnkey platform that standardizes image capture, performs AI-powered analysis, and reports clinically relevant biomarkers in real time.

## System Components

- **Acquisition hardware** with controlled illumination, autofocus, and patient guidance cues
- **Image enhancement** pipeline for denoising, color normalization, and glare suppression
- **Capillary analytics** that measure loop density, tortuosity, hemorrhages, and avascular areas
- **Clinical dashboard** integrating patient history, NFC trends, and decision-support recommendations

## Collaborations & Impact

- Joint studies with rheumatology clinics to validate AI measurements against expert annotations
- Integration with digital healthcare records for longitudinal monitoring
- Contribution of annotated NFC datasets to the broader research community
