## Abstract

This study proposes and is developing a novel approach for de-identifying and classifying the actions of bedridden patients using an RGB-DVS hybrid sensor system. 

We are first leveraging an RGB camera to identify the patient's initial state. A DVS generation model, which has been pre-trained on DVS data, is then being used to create de-identified data. 

Subsequently, we are developing a model to estimate the patient's current posture from this de-identified data, which will result in an algorithm that can accurately predict the patient's real-time state.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First Design**: De-identification through DVS data
- **Hybrid Sensor System**: RGB-DVS integration
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous patient state prediction
- **Healthcare Innovation**: Addressing privacy concerns in medical settings

## Research Pipeline

1. **Initial State Detection**: RGB camera for patient identification
2. **De-identification**: Pre-trained DVS generation model
3. **Posture Estimation**: Deep learning from de-identified data
4. **Real-time Prediction**: Continuous patient state monitoring

## Applications

- Hospital patient monitoring
- Elderly care facilities
- Home healthcare systems
- Privacy-compliant medical AI
