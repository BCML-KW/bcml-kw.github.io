## Research Area Overview

Healthcare is evolving rapidly thanks to connected sensors and AI. Our lab develops applications that merge medical expertise with machine learning so hospitals, clinicians, and patients can access actionable insights anywhere.

### Nailfold Capillaroscopy

Nailfold Capillaroscopy (NFC) provides a non-invasive window into microvascular health. We focus on vessel segmentation, anomaly scoring, and decision support dashboards that help rheumatologists and neurologists detect early systemic diseases.

### Healthcare Platforms

Building on rapid hardware advances and wearable devices, we deliver digital therapeutics capable of remote monitoring and personalized interventions. AI models interpret biometric streams, estimate physical conditions, and guide clinicians with explainable recommendations.

### Wearable Devices

We engineer low-power wearable systems that gather high-fidelity biosignals, transmit them securely, and run on-device analytics for anomaly detection. The research spans embedded design, communication protocols, and AI deployment pipelines.

### Internet of Things

Our IoT research orchestrates networks of healthcare devices, ensuring reliable data exchange between patients and caregivers. We optimize network-based control strategies so the next-generation healthcare ecosystem remains responsive and secure.
