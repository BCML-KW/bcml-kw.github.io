## Overview

This project explores AI-powered medical imaging for hematology and microvascular screening. By counting white blood cells (WBCs) and analyzing nailfold capillary flow, clinicians gain early warnings about infections or systemic diseases without invasive procedures.

## Components

- Classical and deep vision models for WBC segmentation and counting
- Nailfold video analytics that track blood flow velocity and vessel morphology
- Reporting tools that summarize abnormalities for clinicians and researchers

## Description

White Blood Cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes, are an important part of the immunes system. Hidden infections and undiagnosed medical conditions could be estimated by counting the WBCs. Nailfold capillary is micro-vessel placed under nail. Our research is to build non invasive WBC system by analyze the blood flow within nailfold capillary using machine learning.
