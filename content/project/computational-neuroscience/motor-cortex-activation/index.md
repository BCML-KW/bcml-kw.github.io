## Project Overview

Motor imagery allows individuals to rehearse movements mentally, producing measurable EEG activity in the motor cortex. We analyzed these signals to estimate intended actions, paving the way for assistive technologies that respond to cognitive commands.

## Key Contributions

- Preprocessing pipelines for low-SNR EEG recorded during motor imagery tasks
- Classification models that distinguish multiple imagined motions
- Insights that informed our collaborative work on rehabilitation robotics and neurofeedback training

## Description

Motor imagery is a mental process by which an individual rehearses or simulates a given action. From computer science perspective, we are studying the way to estimaing the action from the electrical signal from the brain(EEG).
