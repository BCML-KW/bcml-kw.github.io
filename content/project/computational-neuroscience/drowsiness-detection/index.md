## Summary

To keep operators safe, we studied physiological correlates of fatigue using four EEG bands—delta, theta, alpha, beta—paired with ECG-derived metrics. The combined feature space captures transitions into drowsy states earlier than behavioral cues, enabling proactive alerts.

## Outcomes

- Generated labeled datasets for fatigue modeling in vehicles and control rooms
- Validated that multimodal biosignals outperform single-modality detectors
- Provided groundwork for subsequent remote cognitive assessment tools

## Description

Studies have investigated various physiological associations with fatigue to try to identify fatigue indicators. The current study assessed the four electroencephalography (EEG) activities, delta (d), theta (h), alpha (a) and beta (b).
