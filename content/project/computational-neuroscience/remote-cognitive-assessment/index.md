## Abstract

The Remote Cognitive Assessment Suite (RCAS) is a web-native environment that lets clinicians and researchers conduct remote cognitive assessments while simultaneously supporting 비대면 과제 for neuroscience education. The platform synchronizes browser tasks (n-back, Stroop, go/no-go) with wearable EEG, ECG, and eye-tracking streams, producing trial-grade datasets without in-person lab visits.

## Key Features

- **Tele-assignment workflows** with automated scheduling, consent, and grading pipelines
- **Multi-signal ingestion** via WebBluetooth and companion mobile apps for EEG/ECG devices
- **Digital biomarker extraction** to estimate cognitive load, stress, and attention lapses
- **Analytics dashboard** for instructors, clinicians, and caregivers to monitor longitudinal trends

## Impact

- Supports decentralized and hybrid clinical studies that require continuous cognitive monitoring
- Provides clinicians with objective metrics for cognitive rehabilitation and tele-neurology programs
- Continues to power remote lab courses (비대면 과제) and generates datasets for joint computational neuroscience and AI studies
