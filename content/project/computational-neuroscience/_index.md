## Research Area Overview

We translate neuroscience principles into computational models that inform AI, digital therapeutics, and tele-neurology. By collaborating with clinicians and educators, we ensure that each model can be used in remote assignments, online labs, and longitudinal studies.

### Focus Topics

- Encoding of attention, memory, and decision-making in neural populations
- Remote experimentation platforms for neuroscience education
- Cognitive state tracking through multimodal biosignals
- Joint modeling of neural and physiological signals for disease monitoring
