## Project Snapshot

Biosignals such as ECG and PPG carry critical information about cardiovascular health, fatigue, and stress. This project explored deep CNN/LSTM architectures that can ingest multi-channel biosignals, remove noise, and deliver actionable predictions in real time.

## Deliverables

- Signal preprocessing scripts for wearable deployments
- CNN + bidirectional LSTM models tuned for arrhythmia classification, sleep staging, and stress detection
- Real-time health monitoring prototypes that stream predictions to clinician dashboards

## Legacy

The techniques pioneered here now support many of BCML's digital healthcare initiatives, from Nailfold Capillaroscopy analytics to remote patient monitoring platforms.

## Description

Bio-signal is very important in health care area. So we analyze various bio-signal data such as ECG(electrocardiography), PPG(Photoplethysmography). We are studying and using deep learning to process bio-signal data well.  Furthermore, We are working to develop real-time health monitoring technology.
