## Problem Statement

Extracting meaningful images and captions from dense documents is tedious but essential for evidence-based reporting. We developed deep learning workflows that localize figures, read surrounding text, and store the resulting assets inside searchable datasets.

## Approach

- Layout-aware CNN detectors identify figures, tables, and highlight regions
- OCR and NLP modules parse captions, labels, and narratives
- A data pipeline organizes the extracted assets into structured repositories for downstream analytics

## Outcomes

The system dramatically reduced the manual effort required to build training corpora for our healthcare models, enabling rapid experimentation on newly published literature and internal reports.

## Description

Recognizing and extracting interested images and captions in a document is difficult but ideal work. We are studying on extracting, analyzing data using deep learning algorithms and then storing it automatically.
