## Research Area Overview

Anomaly Detection links together our historical efforts in data mining, healthcare analytics, wearable sensing, and IoT. Whether the data source is a microvascular image, a sleep-stage hypnogram, or an industrial sensor stream, our pipelines learn what “normal” looks like and quickly raise alerts when deviations appear.

### Focus Topics

- Multimodal anomaly and novelty detection for smart hospitals and edge devices
- Signal-quality estimation for ECG/PPG wearables
- Digital twin simulations that generate rare-but-critical failure cases

## Featured Projects

- [Multimodal Anomaly Detection Platform](/project/anomaly-detection/multimodal-anomaly-detection/)
